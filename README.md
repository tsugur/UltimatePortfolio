# Ultimate Portfolio
### Tsugur Tsugurov

This is my portfolio project

I've tried to implement almost everything I know

Built completely with SwiftUI (no UIKit at all)

Data managed with CoreData + iCloud integration

I'm also planning to make it available on macOS and watchOS (maybe even tvOS, who knows) </br>
But later </br>
Now I'm exploring StoreKit, Apple Pay, Widgets and Spotlight </br>
